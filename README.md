# Aviation Risk Analysis and Recommendations

The analysis used the "Aviation Accident Database" and Tableau visualizations to identify low-risk aircraft and recommend safer models and practices for entering the aviation industry.

Business Problem Statement:


## Project Overview
This project supports a companyâ€™s strategic expansion into the aviation industry by identifying low-risk aircraft using the ["Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) from Kaggle. The goal is to provide actionable insights and recommendations to minimize commercial and private aviation risks.

## Steps Undertaken

### 1. Data Preparation
![clean data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RezuwanHassan262/Aviation-Accident-Data-Analysis-and-Business-Recommendations/main/images/13.jpg) 
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values.
- Standardized features like aircraft type and manufacturer.
- Removed irrelevant columns to focus on critical risk factors.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed accident patterns across:

  - **Aircraft accident occurance frequency mapping**
  - **Aircraft type**
  - **Manufacturer**
  - **Purpose of use** (commercial vs. private)
  - **Weather conditions**
  - **Accident severity**
- Examined trends over time to understand how risks evolved.

## Key Findings
1. **Manufacturer and Model Reliability**:
   - Certain aircraft models demonstrated consistently lower accident rates relative to their market share, suggesting higher reliability.

2. **Commercial vs. Private Aviation**:
   - Commercial aviation showed fewer accidents per flight compared to private aviation due to stricter regulatory oversight and maintenance standards.

3. **Weather-Related Risks**:
   - Adverse weather conditions, such as low visibility, significantly contributed to accidents, highlighting the importance of weather-compatible aircraft.

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Aircraft Selection**:
   - Focus on models with a proven safety record and strong maintenance support from manufacturers.

2. **Weather Compatibility**:
   - Prioritize aircraft with advanced navigation and weather systems to reduce risks during adverse conditions.

3. **Operational Practices**:
   - Invest in training and compliance systems to enhance safety in private aviation operations.

## Visualizations
The analysis also includes Tableau dashboards to provide interactive visualizations of the curated data, offering deeper insights into accident trends and risk factors. Few insights from the data i also shown in [Tableau Dashboard and Sheets](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/md.reuzwan.hassan/viz/AviationAccidentDatabaseTableauDashboards/Dashboard1)

## Business Impact
The insights and recommendations enable decision-makers to strategically evaluate aircraft purchase options, ensuring a balance between operational efficiency and safety while entering the aviation market.
