![barplot_subplots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RezuwanHassan262/Aviation-Accident-Data-Analysis-and-Business-Recommendations/main/images/2.png)
  
  - **Injury severity**
  - **Aircraft damage**
  - **Aircraft category**
  - **Manufacturer**
  - **Number of engines**
  - **Engine types**
  - **FAR description**
  - **Purpose of use**
  - **Weather conditions**
  - **Phase of flight during which the accident occurred**
    
- Examined trends over time to understand how risks evolved.

## Key Findings
1. **Manufacturer and Model Reliability**:
   - Certain aircraft models demonstrated consistently lower accident rates relative to their market share, suggesting higher reliability.

2. **Commercial vs. Private Aviation**:
   - Commercial aviation showed fewer accidents per flight compared to private aviation due to stricter regulatory oversight and maintenance standards.

3. **Weather-Related Risks**:
   - Adverse weather conditions, such as low visibility, significantly contributed to accidents, highlighting the importance of weather-compatible aircraft.

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations
1. **Aircraft Selection**:
   - Focus on models with a proven safety record and strong maintenance support from manufacturers.

2. **Weather Compatibility**:
   - Prioritize aircraft with advanced navigation and weather systems to reduce risks during adverse conditions.

3. **Operational Practices**:
   - Invest in training and compliance systems to enhance safety in private aviation operations.

## Tableau Dashboard Visualizations

The analysis also includes Tableau dashboards to provide interactive visualizations of the curated data, offering deeper insights into accident trends and risk factors. Few insights from the data i also shown in [Tableau Dashboard and Sheets](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/md.reuzwan.hassan/viz/AviationAccidentDatabaseTableauDashboards/Dashboard1)
